# Token Ring Network Simulation

This is a Python implementation of a token ring network simulation that uses UDP for communication between nodes. The program implements a token-based protocol for message transmission in a ring network topology.

## Features

- Token-based message transmission
- UDP communication between nodes
- Message queue with maximum size of 10 messages
- CRC32 error checking
- Random error injection
- Support for unicast and broadcast messages
- Token monitoring and regeneration
- Configurable node settings

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external dependencies required (uses only standard library)

## Configuration

Each node requires a configuration file with the following format:

```
<ip_destino_do_token>:porta
<apelido_da_máquina_atual>
<tempo_token>
<token>
```

Example:
```
10.32.143.12:6000
Bob
1
true
```

## Usage

1. Create a configuration file for each node in your network
2. Run the program for each node:
   ```bash
   python Tokentrip.py <config_file>
   ```
3. Use the following commands in the program:
   - `send <destination> <message>` - Send a message to a specific destination
   - `quit` - Exit the program

## Message Format

The program uses two types of packets:

1. Token Packet:
   ```
   9000
   ```

2. Data Packet:
   ```
   7777:<status>;<origin>;<destination>;<CRC>;<message>
   ```

## Error Handling

The program implements several error handling mechanisms:

- CRC32 error checking
- Random error injection
- Token monitoring and regeneration
- NACK/ACK responses
- Destination availability checking

## Network Topology

The network operates in a ring topology where:
- Each node knows only its right neighbor
- Messages travel clockwise around the ring
- The token circulates to control message transmission
- Only one message can be transmitted at a time
- Messages return to their origin before the token is passed

## Broadcast Messages

To send a message to all nodes, use "TODOS" as the destination:
```
send TODOS Hello everyone!
```
